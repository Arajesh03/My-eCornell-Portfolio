Define and Solve an ML Problem
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook where I follow the machine learning life cycle to define and solve a predictive problem of my own choosing, using real-world data.
This project is structured as an end-to-end ML workflow: from data selection and problem definition, through exploratory data analysis, model building, and performance improvement.

üìä Project Overview
Lab Goal:

Select a data set from several real-world options.

Define a predictive machine learning problem the data supports.

Explore and clean the data.

Plan and implement an ML solution.

Analyze and improve results.

Datasets Provided:

Census Data (censusData.csv)

Airbnb NYC Listings (airbnbListingsData.csv)

World Happiness Report (WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.csv)

Book Review Data (bookReviewsData.csv)

See the notebook for which dataset was selected and the precise ML problem defined.

üöÄ Project Workflow
Build Your DataFrame:

Choose and load a dataset as a Pandas DataFrame.

Define Your ML Problem:

Clearly state the problem: what are you predicting? What is your target variable?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Inspect features, visualize relationships, identify patterns, and check data quality.

Project Plan:

Select features, decide on ML model type (classification/regression), choose evaluation metrics.

Implementation:

Data preprocessing (cleaning, encoding, splitting).

Fit a model to training data and evaluate on test data.

Improve model performance (tune hyperparameters, try alternate algorithms).

üßë‚Äçüíª How to Run the Project

üìà Results
Model performance and findings are detailed in the notebook.

Typical results include evaluation metrics (accuracy, RMSE, etc.), visualizations, and interpretation of outcomes.

Iterative improvement steps (feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning) are also shown.

üìù Learning Outcomes
Experience with the full ML workflow: data loading, problem definition, EDA, modeling, and evaluation.

Hands-on skills with Pandas, scikit-learn, and visualization tools.

Understanding how to define a clear ML problem from a dataset.
