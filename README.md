# First Machine Learning Problem

![Project Overview](ecornell.png)

This repository contains my first end-to-end machine learning project.  
I select a real-world dataset, define a predictive problem, perform exploratory data analysis, and build ML models to solve it.

## üìù Project Description

This project explores the complete machine learning lifecycle:
- Dataset selection (from census, Airbnb, World Happiness, or book reviews)
- Defining a clear ML problem (e.g., sentiment analysis on book reviews)
- Data cleaning, visualization, and feature engineering
- Model training, evaluation, and interpretation

## üìä Data Exploration

* Inspected data shape, feature types, and missing values
* Visualized class distributions and sample data
* Example plot:

## ü§ñ Model Development

* Preprocessing: tokenization, vectorization, encoding
* Models tried: logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, etc.
* Evaluation: accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix

<a id="results--findings"></a>

## üìà Results & Findings

* Best model: \[e.g., Logistic Regression, 82% accuracy]
* Key insights:

  * \[e.g., Text length and certain words highly correlated with positive reviews]
* See notebook for detailed results and visualizations.
